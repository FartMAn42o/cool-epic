Github Status Embed for Discord.

This applications sends an enhanced GitHub Actions Status Embed to a
Discord webhook. The default embeds sent by GitHub don't contain a lot
of information and are send for every workflow run. This application,
part of a Docker-based action, allows you to send more meaningful embeds
when you want to send them.
